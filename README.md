# savages

Baswd on my memory of Little Savages 2 by Matt Squirrell.  
It has been a very long time since I played the 'game', but I have really fond memories of it.

## notes
- each savage is on a 1 meter square
  - if distance <= 10 meter there is a chance of an encounter. The closer the higher.
  - if sex is diff then there is a chance of mating if compatible. 
    - Charisma should be a part of this. 
- There is a random chance of finding water. There is no fixed location of water (yet).
- There is a random chance of finding food.

Help would be very ***nice***!


- Children stay with the mother until the age of 10.  
  - There is a chance if the mother's owner is not the same as the child's owner that the mother will harm the child.
- Need personality modifiers.
  - Kindness / Aggression
  - Good / Bad hunter gatherer
  - yadda yadda
