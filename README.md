# savages

Baswd on my memory of little savages 2

## notes
- each savage is on a 1 meter square
  - if distance <= 10 meter there is a chance of an encounter. The closer the higher.
  - if sex is diff then there is a chance of mating if compatible. 
- There is a random chance of finding water. There is no fixed location of water (yet).
- There is a random chance of finding food.
